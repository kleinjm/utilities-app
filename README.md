# Utilities App / Utilitizer
A simple app used to prototype the aggregation of utility payments. The app helps users enter their account information and payment methods and then aggregates their payment due dates onto one central calendar. Alerts are in place to remind users of their upcoming or past-due payments.

The prototype tests the concept and the UI/UX. No full-scale app has been created from this prototype.
